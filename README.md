# Appendix A - Questionnaire
Questionnnaire used in study as described in section 3.

### Background

* Could you describe your current role?
* Could you provide a brief background on your experience in working with open data and/or open source software?
* Could you describe the vision and purpose of your platform? What role does your organization play? What incentives do you have?

### Platform Content

* Could you describe the data-sets that you publish on your platform?
* Could you describe the data's origin and any steps taken before it is published on your platform?
* Do you in anyway gather data from third party and share via your platform?
* How can third party access the data? What is required from them?
* Can third party in any way contribute to and share data via your platform? If so, how? Can you provide an example?
* Have you released any software as open source? If so, what?

### Ecosystem Governance Structure

* Could you describe the users of the data-sets (and potentially software) provided via your platform? For example, in regards to type of business/operation, size, maturity, and use of data/software.
* Could you describe the requirements engineering and roadmapping process for your platform and its APIs? For example, the elicitation and assertion of requirements, as well as the analysis and prioritization of them.
* How do you decide what data to share and how? From where do the requirements and input originate?
* Are there any actors in the ecosystem [keystones] that are of extra importance in terms of the elicitation and prioritization of requirements?
* How can these actors [keystones] provide input and influence the development of the platform, what is shared, and how?
* How can actors of the ecosystem in general influence the development of the platform, what is shared, and how?

### Orchestration and Collaboration

* Could you describe in what ways (if any) the actors of the ecosystem are engaged, or enabled, to participate in the development of the platform, what is shared, and how?
* Could you describe the infrastructure used to support the development process? In what ways (if any) does it support an open collaboration with the ecosystem? 
* Could you describe how source code and project artifacts (e.g., documentation, roadmaps, backlog) (if any) are shared with the ecosystem?
* Could you describe how you communicate and interact with the ecosystem? Differentiate between digital (synchronous and asynchronous communication) and physical interaction (e.g., meet-ups, hackathons, and conferences).
* Could you describe in what ways (if any) you support the ecosystem in getting started with their use of the platform?
* Could you describe the process for reporting and managing tickets, including bugs, improvements, and features? In what ways (if any) can the ecosystem, be involved in this process?

### External Contributions and Engagements

* Do you in any way contribute to and engage in any external communities or ecosystems? E.g., OSM. 
* Could you describe and exemplify these engagements?
* What benefits and challenges do you see?
* Do you collaborate with any other actors from your own ecosystem in these external engagements?
